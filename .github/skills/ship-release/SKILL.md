# Ship a release

## Steps

1. **Gate.** All of these must hold:
   - `main` CI is green: `gh run list --branch main --limit 1`
   - No open `priority:p0` PRs that are meant to be in this release
   - The demo path works locally. Run through the demo script in `docs/SPEC.md`.

2. **Pick a version**: use `v0.x.0` while iterating, and `v1.0.0` for the judged build.
   ```bash
   git checkout main && git pull --ff-only
   gh release create v<X.Y.Z> --generate-notes --title "v<X.Y.Z>: <name>"
   ```
   Release notes are generated from merged PR titles, which is why PR titles must be clean.

3. **Deploy.** Follow the "Deploy" section in `AGENTS.md`. If the deploy isn't automated yet, write the exact steps you ran into `AGENTS.md` so the next person can repeat them.

4. **Smoke test** the deployed URL: load the app, then run the 3–5 demo steps.

5. **Freeze**: within the last hour before judging, recommend that only `fix:` PRs touching the demo path get merged.

Report the release URL, the deploy URL, and the smoke-test result.
